I track how I am doing on this spreadsheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fVg4lg-M-CCINVhhRNMI1Z20zX6pnFukItU0NfwwKfY/edit?usp=sharing

The sheet tracks completion time, and the space and time complexity percentile compared to others.
Color on the left is relative to the 0-100% metric
Color on the right is relative to other values within the column
